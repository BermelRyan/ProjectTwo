1.) How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

In creating programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I try to make the program transferable and modular. An example of this would be the CRUD method used in previous projects. By doing this, it can increase productivity and create programs that are easy to understand and use.


2.) How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

The approach I use tends to be critical thinking. I first start off by listing everything that I need to implement into the program and then work on that list one by one making sure everything is in working order before moving on to the next item.


3.) What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists solve challenges to create quality software at the clients request. This is important to companies to allow for better productivity in the workplace.
